# Clojure DSL for apache camel ![Clojure CI](https://github.com/TakeoffTech/clj-camel/workflows/Clojure%20CI/badge.svg)

##Motivation

Camel is an open source integration framework that empowers you to quickly and easily integrate various systems consuming or producing data.

This library adds a thin layer on top of Java [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org) and 
provides a more idiomatic experience of using Apache Camel in the Clojure ecosystem, without changing the original functionality.


## Installation

Include in your project.clj

```clojure
[takeoff/clj-camel "1.0.0"]
```


## Usage

```clojure
(require [clj-camel.core :as c]
         [clj-camel.util :as cu])
```

## Examples

Simple route
```clojure
(c/route-builder (c/from "direct:test")
                 (c/route-id "test-route")
                 (c/set-body (c/constant "test-body"))
                 (c/log "log: ${body}")
                 (c/to "direct:result"))
```

Filter ([original doc](https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/eips/filter-eip.html))
```clojure
    (c/route-builder (c/from "direct:test")
                     (c/route-id "test-route")
                     (c/to "http://test-http")
                     (c/filter (c/predicate (comp pos? :body))
                               (c/log "Filtered ... ${body}")
                               (c/to "direct:result"))
                     (c/process (fn [_] {:body "after filter"})))
```

Choice ([original doc](https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/eips/choice-eip.html))

                                   (c/process some-processor))
                           (c/when (c/predicate (comp neg? :body))
                                   (c/log "when 2")
                                   (c/process some-processor))
                           (c/otherwise
                                   (c/log "otherwise")
                                   (c/process some-processor)))
