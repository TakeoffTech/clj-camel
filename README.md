![Clojure CI](https://github.com/TakeoffTech/clj-camel/workflows/Clojure%20CI/badge.svg)

The library adds a thin layer on top of Java Apache Camel.

## Installation

Include in your project.clj

     [takeoff/clj-camel "1.0.0"]


## Usage

    (require [clj-camel.core :as c]
             [clj-camel.util :as cu])

## Examples

Simple route

    (c/route-builder (c/from "direct:test")
                     (c/route-id "test-route")
                     (c/set-body (c/constant "test-body"))
                     (c/log "log: ${body}")
                     (c/to "direct:result"))

Filter

    (c/route-builder (c/from "direct:test")
                     (c/route-id "test-route")
                     (c/to "http://test-http")
                     (c/filter (c/predicate (comp pos? :body))
                               (c/log "Filtered ... ${body}")
                               (c/to "direct:result"))
                     (c/process (fn [_] {:body "after filter"})))

Choice

    (c/route-builder (c/choice (c/when (c/predicate (comp pos? :body))
                                       (c/log "when 1")
                                       (c/process some-processor))
                               (c/when (c/predicate (comp neg? :body))
                                       (c/log "when 2")
                                       (c/process some-processor))
